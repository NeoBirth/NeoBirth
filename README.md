Acid house music program for the [Adafruit NeoTrellis M4], powered by the
[PureZen] music synthesis engine (a [Pure Data] engine targeting embedded
Rust devices).

Inspired by [Propellerhead ReBirth].

## Status

The current code produces a working executable which can be loaded onto a
NeoTrellis M4 device, however no functionality is yet in place (unless you
like blinking LEDs).

## Requirements

- NeoTrellis M4 Express device
- Rustup and Rust 1.31+: https://rustup.rs/ 
- `rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf`
- [GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain]
- [BOSSA] (flash programming utility for Atmel's SAM microcntrollers)

## Compiling

```
$ CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo build --release
$ cd target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary neobirth neobirth.bin
```

## Flashing the NeoTrellis M4

Press the `RESET` button on the back of the NeoTrellis M4 twice in rapid
succession. The LED on the back will turn *green*. 

Then run:

```
$ bossac -e -w -v -b -R -o 0x4000 --port=/dev/<your platform dev> neobirth.bin
```

Note that the `--port` flag for `bossac` varies by OS:

- Linux: `/dev/ttyACM0`
- macOS: `/dev/tty.usbmodemNNNNNN` (try `ls /dev/tty.usbmodem*`)
